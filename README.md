# ml-classifier
This project cleans and organizes real data from the Cornell Veterinary school using Panda dataframes. This classifier is designed to predict if a dog's leg is lame based on demographic information and force gait plate analysis. The initial challenges of this project was filling missing values in the table. Methods of imputation such as taking the average, median, or linear regression were tested, and the median was found to be most effective. This model utilizes linear support vector machines to classify data. Other algorithms such as random forest, and linear regression were determined to have a higher error rate. Through testing, parameter inputs to this algorithm were further optimized.
